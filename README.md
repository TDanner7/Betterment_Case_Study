# Betterment_Case_Study

## Background

Betterment, which came to market in 2010, is a *Robo-Advisor* platform created by Jonathan Stein, Eli Broverman, Sean Owen, and Ryan O'Sullivan in 2008. Jonathan originally had the idea, while the other three brought crutial knowledge to the company before its inception. It had "occurred to (Jonathan) that the concepts (he'd) learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes (he) was making in managing (his) own investments." He regularly mentions a saying that he was taught in collage which clearly shows his disrupter mentality : "is isn't ought" which means just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it should be that way.

While betterment was created in 2008 Jonathan and team were forced to wait two years to release the product to market. This was due to the lengthy process of getting their Broker-Dealer set up. After two long years of taking no salaries and putting all their blood sweat and tears into the creation of this revolutionary product, they finally took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt. TechCrunch Disrupt is a conferance which hones in on industry players who are making waves in the tech world. Although they presented against many companies that had already secured funding they were able to make waves and were honored with 'Biggest New York Disrupter'. This was great press for Betterment and they quickly received 400 users on their platform. This buzz, and proof of interest, allowed them to secure their first round of investors. 

## Business

The first line of their mission reads "We are here to empower people to do what's best for their money so they can live better." They do this by allowing **everybody** the opportunity to have an advisor. Betterment achieves this by offering a virtual advisor to anybody with an internet connection.
