# Betterment_Case_Study

## Background

Betterment, which came to market in 2010, is a *Robo-Advisor* platform created by Jonathan Stein, Eli Broverman, Sean Owen, and Ryan O'Sullivan in 2008. Jonathan originally had the idea, while the other three brought crutial knowledge to the company before its inception. It had "occurred to (Jonathan) that the concepts (he'd) learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes (he) was making in managing (his) own investments." He regularly mentions a saying that he was taught in collage which clearly shows his disrupter mentality : "is isn't ought" which means just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it should be that way.

While betterment was created in 2008 Jonathan and team were forced to wait two years to release the product to the market. This was due to the lengthy process of becoming a licensed Broker-Dealer. After two long years of taking no salaries and putting all their blood sweat and tears into the creation of this revolutionary product, they finally took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt. TechCrunch Disrupt is a conferance which hones in on industry players who are making waves in the tech world. Although they presented against many companies that had already secured funding they were able to make waves and were honored with 'Biggest New York Disrupter'. This was great press for Betterment and they quickly received 400 users on their platform. This buzz, and proof of interest, allowed them to secure their first round of funding. 

## Business Activities

Betterment recognized that there was a large portion of the population that was under serviced while simultaniously being priced out of the currently offered wealth management options. They set out to create an affordable, accessible, and effective solution to this problem. Although Betterment may say that their solution is for everybody, and theoretically it is, its main target audient are people who can not afford a traditional wealth managers and / or want a simpler solution. They achieve this by allowing users to have a 'robot' invester on their phone / laptop. By doing so the company is able to eliminate the human wealth manager and thus they are not limited to a certain amount of clients nor do they have the overhead cost of the wealth managers themselves. Furthermore, by using data driven investment based on modern portfolio theory, Betterment is able to confidently inform and direct clients without the need for human analysis. All of this equates to lower overhead and a lower barrier to entry for the client.

It should be noted that Betterment does now offer premium clients access to Certified Financial Planners (CFPs), Although, this is not their main target audience. 

## Landscape

Betterment fits broudly within the Consumer Finance industry which contains companies and products that focus on the borrowing, saving, and investmenting. The broud industry has seen trendous change in the past 15 years with companies like Plaid, Affirm, and Upstart all stiving to bring fast and easy transactions to the public. More specifically, though, Betterment is in a smaller sector of the industry which is money management / Investments. Similiar to the brouder group, this corner of the industry has seen much change. No longer is the time when wealth managers can gate keep their simple, yet unobtainable, investment strategies. Betterment, as well as its competitors, now offer investment strategies previously only accessible to the public through a wealth manager. Although Betterment is the first and arguably the best Robo-Advisor, it is not the only Robo-Advisor in the Market. Some of its direct competitors are as follows: Wealthfront, SoFi, Vanguard Digital Advisor, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, and Fidelity Go. Although these products are all fairly similar, Betterment has shown that it is the best platform for beginners. They hold this crown due to their very low barrier to entry: $0 required account balance and only a $10 requirement to begin investing.

## Results

The inception of Betterment has paved the way for a brand new untapped market. They have allowed for the common person to take advantage of what was previously only been available to the rich. This has provided the their target market with more autonomy and opportunity. By doing so Betterment has become very successful. This success can be measured by a number of metrics, but mainly their Assets Under Management (AUM). Betterment has the highest AUM of any of the stand alone Robo-Advisors. Their current AUM is $26.8 billion with 615,000 individual clients. This puts them $5.4 billion ahead of the next largest stand alone Robo-Advisor, Wealthfront. Although Vanguard Digital Advisor and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios do have much higher AUMs, these are large established entities which were able to leverage their current client base and their recognition to amass a large user base.

## Recommendation

As this corner of the market continues to exand it becomes even more imperative to differenciate yourself from the crowd. As mentioned, Betterment already does this through providing the best platform for begginer investors, but soon the market will flood with many similar platforms targetting the same market. based on my market analysis I think it would greatly benifit Betterment to provide access to individual stock picking. This would benifit them because it would attrack young people who are interested in trading, in addition, because they are targeting begginer investors they are often younger meaning they are often interested in higher risk investments.





The first line of their mission reads "We are here to empower people to do what's best for their money so they can live better." They do this by allowing **everybody** the opportunity to have an advisor. Betterment achieves this by offering a virtual advisor to anybody with an internet connection.
